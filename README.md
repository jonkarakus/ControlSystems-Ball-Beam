# Ball and Beam Control Systems Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to design and implement a control system for a Ball and Beam system, focusing on achieving targeted settling time, steady state error, and percent overshoot. We employ Proportional-Derivative (PD) control and Root Locus techniques to optimize the system's performance according to the specified criteria.

## Objectives

- **Settling Time:** Achieve a settling time of less than X seconds.
- **Steady State Error:** Maintain a steady state error within Y% of the target position.
- **Percent Overshoot:** Limit the percent overshoot to Z%.

## Methodology

### PD Control
The PD control strategy involves tuning the proportional and derivative gains to meet the performance specifications. This approach aims to improve the system's response time and stability without significantly increasing overshoot.

### Root Locus Control
Root Locus control methodology is employed to further refine the system's performance. By analyzing the root locus plots, we adjust the controller parameters to achieve the desired settling time, steady state error, and percent overshoot.
